Installation
############

Normal install
--------------

1. Extract and place the `minconky` folder inside the `.conky` folder. If 
   there is no `.conky` folder inside your `home` directory, you may want to 
   create one. 

2. Start the conky using the following command:
   conky -c /home/<your_username>/.conky/minconky/conky_rc
   
Alternative (advanced) install
------------------------------

Should you wish to use the `conky_rc` as your default `.conkyrc`, use this 
method.

1. Rename the `conky_rc` file to `.conkyrc`. (If the file disappears, just 
   press Ctrl + H).

2. Move the `.conkyrc` file into your `home` directory.
   
5. You may need to install the fonts if you don't have them.

6. Open your terminal and type conky.
